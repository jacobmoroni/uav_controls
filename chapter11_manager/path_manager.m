% input is:
%   num_waypoints - number of waypoint configurations
%   waypoints    - an array of dimension 5 by P.size_waypoint_array.
%                - the first num_waypoints rows define waypoint
%                  configurations
%                - format for each waypoint configuration:
%                  [wn, we, wd, chi_d, Va_d]
%                  where the (wn, we, wd) is the NED position of the
%                  waypoint, chi_d is the desired course at the waypoint,
%                  and Va_d is the desired airspeed along the path.  If
%                  abs(chi_d)<2*pi then Dubins paths will be followed
%                  between waypoint configurations.  If abs(chi_d)>=2*pi
%                  then straight-line paths (with fillets) are commanded.
%
% output is:
%   flag - if flag==1, follow waypoint path
%          if flag==2, follow orbit 
%   Va_d - desired airspeed
%   r    - inertial position of start of waypoint path
%   q    - unit vector that defines inertial direction of waypoint path
%   c    - center of orbit
%   rho  - radius of orbit
%   lambda = direction of orbit (+1 for CW, -1 for CCW)
